# Exercise-Tracker: 
  Used  MERN stack to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by User.
  Used React for the Front-end UI app. Wrote REST API that supports CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
  using Node and Express for the Back-end web service.
  For persistence used MongoDB.

  1) cd into "React" and run "npm install"
  2) Open an additional terminal and cd into "rest" and again run "npm install"
  3) Once node_modules is installed for "rest" we will run "npm start" and get connected to MongoDB using Mongoose.
  4) Once we get the following message "Successfully connected to MongoDB using Mongoose!", we can go back to primary terminal.
  5) Now we are in React and node_modules is installed. Time to run "npm start".
